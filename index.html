	            <h1>Introduction</h1>
							<p>Hi, I'm Jason. I designed and coded this site over the last few days because I'm excited about Etsy and I wanted to show you that I'm a product manager who is: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>business-oriented</li>
								<li>design-driven,</li>
								<li>technically-capable,</li>
								<li>and who <i>gets</i> Etsy.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The site is built with <a href="http://muicss.com">Muicss</a> and this is my <a href="https://github.com/jasonshen/poweredbysellers">Github repo</a>.</p>
							<h3>Why the Name?</h3>
							<p>I decided to name this site "powered by sellers" because I think PM's on shop management, and the company has a whole, recognizes how important they are to the success of the business — from providing critical product feedback to bringing on new buyers and much more. As <a href="https://blog.etsy.com/news/2015/how-10000-sellers-helped-etsy-develop-new-tools/">Nickey said</a> with the launch of the new Listings Manager:</p>
							<blockquote><i><h4>"Etsy is only successful when our sellers are successful."</h4></i></blockquote>

							<h2>Background Information</h2>
							<p>Wanted to do a quick analysis on how where Etsy stands from a business perspective, and how that translates into goals for the product team, particularly shop management. Based on my conversation with <a href="http://www.jasonshen.com/2014/no-silver-bullets-etsys-randy-hunt-on-product-design/">Randy Hunt back in 2014</a>, thought it would make sense to use the Problem, Strengths, Weaknesses and Tenets model. .</a>

										<p>Etsy’s member acquisition growth rate is decreasing. In 2013 we added  but in 2014 we added Y. While there is still a massive global market for vintage and handcrafted good, it will become more challenging to acquire these users over time. It’s normal for user acquisition to slow but </p>
										<p>Etsy needs to continue finding new sources of revenue while remaining true to its core mission to XX.</p>
									</div>
		              <div class="mui-tab-pane" id="pane-justified-2">
										<p>Etsy has a strong and loyal base of both sellers and buyers. 73% of purchase are repeat purchases and of sellers who stuck around from 2011 onward, their average earnings has grown to 13k a year. Enough to constitute a part-time job. Etsy has been able to grow revenue substantially without increasing fees or massive sales increases by building add-on services for sellers to help them drive their business. These add on services have grown from 2012 to make up XXX percent of revenue</p>
										<p>Etsy's Prototypes system allows PM's to iterate on features, get a sense of how members will respond before moving forward.</p>

										Growth in Mobile
										Huge Opportunity in Global

										12 hours a week of work on average
										74% consider their store a small business
										high earners (20+% of income) spend more than 28 hrs a week
										median age 39, 88% female, 50% college or more, 44.9k income, 85% in metro area
										83% run their business alone
										number one challenge is lack of time, then customer demand
										Outlet for creativity + supplemental income, for fun, for bus opportunity
										Just 26% are full-time employees somewhere else
										2014 - 20M active buyers, 1.4M active sellers (one year?) 36% sales from mobile, 31% sales international
										Probably close to 1800 per seller per year
										20% seller growth a year
										46.1% of Etsy sellers used at least one of our Seller Services. Similarly, we have launched our manufacturing and Wholesale offerings in an effort to enable an Etsy seller to grow her business on our platform.

										Martha, 45 mom of 2 kids (15, 11), does her Etsy store full time, Minnesota. Crafting

										Rachel, 32 freelance writer, engaged, has always Brooklyn. Painting? Photography

										Michael, 28, front-end engineer living in Oakland

										<p>Global revenue is still only a fraction XX of total revenue, giving lots </p>

		              <div class="mui-tab-pane" id="pane-justified-3">
										<p>Etsy’s user acquisition is slowing both on seller and buyer side, XX by the former, XX by the latter. We may be starting to saturate the US market for vintage and handcrafted goods, considering that this slowed growth came after doubling marketing spend in 2014 to $40M. There continues to be concerns with how Etsy defines concepts like "handmade" and  It's possible that as Etsy power sellers get more tech and business savvy, they will look to other marketplaces to list their inventory - sites like Amazon, Shopify, Big Cartel or Squarspace.</p>

								  <div class="mui-tab-pane" id="pane-justified-4">
											<p>All marketplaces eventually become driven by power users. Consider eBay, or Airbnb. Super hosts, Power sellers. Authorship, responsibility, and transparency.</p>

							<h2>User Personas</h2>

							<p>Etsy obviously has many different sellers who have different needs. I've come up with three different fictional personas, each with different needs and challenges that Shop Management can help address.</p>

									<p>Gloria Holland, based in Minneapolis MN, is a mother of two kids and has been a member of Etsy since 2008.</p>
									<p><b>Situation:</b> Gloria's pillow-making efforts started as a way to keep herself busy during her pregnancy, but today, her Etsy store <em>Soft and Sassy</em> brings in over a dozen orders a day and she has a team of five that helps her sew and package these pillows. Like many of the 3,000+ Etsy shops that now have manufacturing partners, Gloria works with a small company that helps create some of the elements of her pillows.</p>
									<p><b>Challenges:</b> Gloria is basically running a small business, and spends 60+ hrs a week dealing with customers, managing orders, overseeing production, getting items shipped, and paying her staff and vendors. She wants Soft and Sassy to grow but she's not sure how she can put more hours into her business while taking care of Jake and Amanda.</p>
